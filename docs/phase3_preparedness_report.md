# Phase 3 Preparedness Report

**Date:** October 4, 2025
**Roadmap Phase:** Phase 3 - Iteration & Tuning (Week 3: Oct 16-22)
**Assessment:** **NOT READY - CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED**

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 2 infrastructure is complete and functional (all tests pass), but **we are not ready for Phase 3** due to critical missing components:

1. **No trained baseline model** - Cannot iterate/tune what doesn't exist
2. **Production agent (`my_agent.py`) not implemented** - No inference path
3. **Baseline evaluation missing** - Cannot measure improvement
4. **No initial training run** - Need baseline metrics before tuning

**Recommended action:** Complete missing Phase 2 deliverables before proceeding to Phase 3.

---

## Phase 2 Roadmap Requirements vs Implementation

### ✓ 2.1 Self-Play Generator
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Evidence:**
- `training/selfplay.py` implemented with MCTS+NN hybrid
- Temperature-based move selection functional
- Experience tuple generation working
- Tests passing: `test_selfplay()` ✓

### ✓ 2.2 Training Loop
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Evidence:**
- `training/train.py` with combined policy+value loss
- Adam optimizer, configurable hyperparameters
- Batch training functional
- Tests passing: `test_training()` ✓

### ✓ 2.3 Checkpoint & Evaluation
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Evidence:**
- `save_checkpoint()` / `load_checkpoint()` implemented
- Arena evaluation in `training/arena.py`
- Wilson score statistical testing
- Tests passing: `test_arena()`, `test_replacement_logic()` ✓

### ✗ **Deliverable: "End-to-end training pipeline producing improving models"**
**Status:** INFRASTRUCTURE ONLY - NO TRAINED MODELS
**Critical gap:** Pipeline exists but has never been run with production parameters.

---

## Phase 3 Readiness Checklist

| Requirement | Status | Evidence | Blocker? |
|-------------|--------|----------|----------|
| **Training infrastructure** | ✓ | All Phase 2 tests pass | No |
| **Initial trained model** | ✗ | No checkpoints exist | **YES** |
| **Baseline metrics** | ✗ | No win rates vs baselines | **YES** |
| **Production inference** | ✗ | `my_agent.py` is stub | **YES** |
| **Profiling baseline** | ✗ | No timing/memory data | **YES** |
| **Hyperparameter grid defined** | ✗ | No search space spec | No |
| **Baseline MCTS comparison** | ✗ | Arena missing baseline agents | **YES** |

**Result:** 5/7 blocking gaps. Cannot proceed to tuning without trained baseline.

---

## Missing Components (Detailed)

### 1. No Trained Baseline Model
**Problem:** Phase 3 requires a model to iterate/tune, but no trained model exists.

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ ls checkpoints/
ls: cannot access 'checkpoints/': No such file or directory
```

**Impact:** Cannot perform:
- Hyperparameter tuning (no baseline to compare against)
- Performance profiling (no real inference workload)
- Strength measurement (no model to evaluate)

**Required action:** Run initial training with production parameters:
```python
training_pipeline(
    num_iterations=10,
    games_per_iter=100,
    num_simulations=40,
    batch_size=256,
    epochs=5,
    arena_games=50
)
```

**Estimated time:** 3-5 hours for 10 iterations

---

### 2. Production Agent Not Implemented
**Problem:** `my_agent.py` is a stub template, not functional agent.

**Current state:**
```python
class MyAwesomeAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, board, color):
        super().__init__(board, color)
        self.policy_net = ...  # Placeholder

    def make_move(self, board, time_limit):
        best_move = ...  # Not implemented
        return best_move
```

**Required implementation:**
1. Load trained ChessNet from checkpoint
2. Run MCTS search with neural guidance
3. Select best move within time_limit
4. CPU-only inference (tournament constraint)
5. Error handling with fallback to random

**Impact:** Cannot test tournament-ready agent or measure time compliance.

**Code location:** [my_agent.py:6-21](my_agent.py#L6-L21)

---

### 3. Baseline Evaluation Missing
**Problem:** Cannot measure improvement without baseline comparisons.

**Current state:**
```python
# training/arena.py:176-194
def evaluate_vs_baseline(...):
    raise NotImplementedError("Baseline evaluation not yet implemented")
```

**Required baselines:**
- ✓ RandomAgent (exists in `random_agent.py`)
- ✓ GreedyAgent (exists in `greedy_agent.py`)
- ✓ Pure MCTS (exists in `mcts_agent.py`)
- ✗ Integration with arena evaluation

**Success criteria (from roadmap):**
- Beat GreedyAgent >70% win rate
- Beat baseline MCTS >55% win rate
- Competitive in tournament (top 50%)

**Impact:** Cannot validate Phase 2 deliverable ("producing improving models").

---

### 4. No Initial Training Metrics
**Problem:** Phase 3 tuning requires baseline metrics to compare against.

**Missing data:**
- Initial model win rate vs baselines
- Games per iteration needed for improvement
- Convergence rate (iterations until plateau)
- Time per iteration with production parameters
- Memory usage during full training run

**Why this matters:**
- Cannot identify which hyperparameters to tune without knowing current bottlenecks
- Cannot set realistic goals ("improve win rate by X%") without baseline
- Cannot detect regressions during tuning

---

### 5. Profiling Data Missing
**Problem:** Phase 3 includes "Final Optimization" requiring profiling data.

**Roadmap requirement (3.3):**
> **Profiling:** Identify bottlenecks (likely MCTS or NN inference)

**Current knowledge:** Only test-scale timings
```python
# From phase2_completion_summary.md
# MCTS search (5 sims): ~0.5s (test scale)
# Self-play game: 15-30s (test scale)
```

**Production scale unknown:**
- MCTS with 40 simulations: ??? (2s budget)
- NN inference time: ??? (CPU-only)
- Batch inference opportunities: ???
- Memory footprint during self-play: ???

**Impact:** Cannot optimize what hasn't been measured.

---

## Dependencies for Phase 3 Tasks

### 3.1 Hyperparameter Tuning
**Blockers:**
1. Need baseline model performance to compare against
2. Need parameter space definition (which params to tune)
3. Need evaluation framework against baselines

**Current state:** Can define search space, but cannot execute without baseline.

### 3.2 Advanced Features
**Blockers:**
1. Must verify basic training works before adding features
2. Need profiling to know if features are worth complexity

**Current state:** Premature - should wait until baseline training succeeds.

### 3.3 Final Optimization
**Blockers:**
1. Requires profiling data from production training run
2. Needs actual bottlenecks identified (not guessed)
3. Must verify 2s time limit compliance

**Current state:** Cannot optimize until baseline measured.

---

## Recommended Path Forward

### Option A: Complete Phase 2 Deliverables (RECOMMENDED)

**Step 1: Initial Training Run** (3-5 hours)
```bash
# Run production training pipeline
python -c "
from training.pipeline import training_pipeline
training_pipeline(
    num_iterations=10,
    games_per_iter=100,
    num_simulations=40,
    batch_size=256,
    epochs=5,
    arena_games=50,
    checkpoint_dir='checkpoints'
)
"
```

**Step 2: Implement Production Agent** (1-2 hours)
- Load best checkpoint in `my_agent.py`
- Implement MCTS inference with time management
- Test against baselines via `test_mcts.py` framework

**Step 3: Baseline Evaluation** (1 hour)
- Implement `evaluate_vs_baseline()` in `arena.py`
- Measure win rates: NN+MCTS vs Random, Greedy, Pure MCTS
- Record metrics for Phase 3 comparison

**Step 4: Profiling** (30 min)
- Run cProfile on self-play and inference
- Measure MCTS time with 40 simulations
- Verify 2s time budget compliance

**Total time:** ~6-8 hours
**Result:** Phase 2 truly complete, ready for Phase 3

---

### Option B: Proceed to Phase 3 with Gaps (NOT RECOMMENDED)

**Why not recommended:**
- Violates "fail fast" principle (CLAUDE.md)
- Cannot tune hyperparameters without baseline
- Risk discovering fundamental issues late (deadline Oct 22)
- Phase 3 timeline assumes working baseline exists

**If chosen anyway:**
- Define hyperparameter search space (can do without training)
- Implement production agent (can do without checkpoint)
- Prepare profiling scripts (can do without data)
- **Cannot execute any tuning experiments**

---

## Risk Assessment

### Timeline Risk: HIGH
**Current date:** Oct 4
**Phase 3 deadline:** Oct 16-22
**Days remaining:** 12-18 days

**If we start Phase 3 now:**
- 0 days: Define search space
- 1 day: Implement agent
- 1 day: Run initial training (should have been done in Phase 2)
- 2 days: Baseline evaluation
- 1 day: Profiling
- **5 days spent on Phase 2 work during Phase 3**
- 7-13 days: Actual tuning/iteration (rushed)

**If we complete Phase 2 first:**
- 1 day: Initial training + evaluation + profiling
- **11-17 days: Full Phase 3 timeline available**

### Quality Risk: HIGH
**Without baseline:**
- Cannot validate improvements (no comparison point)
- Hyperparameter changes may regress but not detected
- No data-driven decisions (guessing which params matter)

**With baseline:**
- Clear improvement metrics
- Data-driven tuning
- Regression detection

### Success Risk: CRITICAL
**Roadmap success criteria:**
> - Beat GreedyAgent consistently (>70% win rate)
> - Beat baseline MCTS (>55% win rate)
> - Competitive in tournament (top 50%)

**Current status:** **CANNOT MEASURE** - no trained model exists

## Alternative: Modify Roadmap

If we determine Phase 2 training is unnecessary, we should update the roadmap to reflect:

**Phase 2 → "Training Infrastructure"** (complete)
- Self-play generation ✓
- Training loop ✓
- Arena evaluation ✓
- Pipeline orchestration ✓

**Phase 3 → "Initial Training + Tuning"** (adjusted)
- Week 1: Initial training run (moved from Phase 2)
- Week 2: Hyperparameter tuning
- Week 3: Optimization

This acknowledges infrastructure ≠ trained model, aligns expectations.

---

## Conclusion

**Phase 3 readiness: NOT READY**

**Critical path:**
1. Run initial training (3-5 hours) → get baseline model
2. Implement production agent (1-2 hours) → enable tournament testing
3. Baseline evaluation (1 hour) → measure success criteria
4. Profiling (30 min) → identify optimization targets

**Total investment:** ~1 day of work to unblock entire Phase 3

**Recommendation:** Complete these tasks before declaring Phase 2 complete or starting Phase 3. This aligns with:
- Roadmap deliverable: "pipeline producing improving models"
- CLAUDE.md principle: "Fail fast and loud" (don't hide missing work)
- Success criteria: Need measurable win rates to validate approach

**Decision required:** Run initial training now or revise roadmap?

---

## Appendix: What Works

Despite gaps, Phase 2 implementation is high quality:

✓ All infrastructure tests pass
✓ Code follows CLAUDE.md principles
✓ Type safety throughout
✓ Clear documentation
✓ Proper error handling
✓ Statistical significance testing
✓ Modular, composable design

**The foundation is solid.** We just need to actually use it to produce the deliverable (trained model).

---

**Next action:** Discuss with user whether to:
1. Run initial training now (complete Phase 2)
2. Revise roadmap (move training to Phase 3)
3. Proceed to Phase 3 with documented gaps (not recommended)
