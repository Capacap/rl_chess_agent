# Phase 1 Completion Summary

**Date:** October 2, 2025
**Status:** ✓ Complete
**Test Results:** All smoke tests passing

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Encoding Module (`encoding/`)
- **state.py**: Board → 13×8×8 tensor encoding
  - 12 planes for pieces (6 white + 6 black)
  - 1 metadata plane (castling rights, side to move)
  - Deterministic encoding verified
- **move.py**: Move ↔ action index (4096 action space)
  - Flat encoding: `from_square * 64 + to_square`
  - Legal move masking implemented
  - Round-trip encoding verified

### 2. Network Architecture (`model/network.py`)
- **ChessNet**: ResNet with policy + value heads
  - 8.8M parameters (target: 8.4M)
  - 64 channels, 4 residual blocks
  - Policy head: 4096-dim masked softmax
  - Value head: scalar tanh output
  - Inference time: **1.7ms** (target: <50ms) ✓

### 3. Data Pipeline (`training/dataset.py`)
- **ChessDataset**: PyTorch Dataset for JSONL experiences
- **save_experience()**: Write experiences to JSONL
- **validate_experience()**: Format validation

### 4. Test Infrastructure (`tests/`)
- Unit tests for encoding, network, dataset
- Integration test for full pipeline
- Smoke test script: `test_phase1_smoke.py`

## Test Results

```
Testing board encoding...
✓ Board encoding shape and dtype correct
✓ Board encoding is deterministic
✓ Move e2e4 encoded as action 796
✓ Move decoding works
✓ Legal move mask correct (20 legal moves)

Testing network architecture...
✓ Network created
✓ Network has 8,832,321 parameters (8.8M)
✓ Forward pass output shapes correct
✓ Policy sums to 1.000000
✓ Value 0.079 in correct range
✓ Illegal moves have zero probability

Testing full integration...
✓ Network selected legal move: h2h4
✓ Network works in mid-game position: d8h4

Testing inference speed...
Average inference time: 1.7ms
✓ Inference time <50ms (meets requirement)
```

## Architecture Validation

### State Encoding
- ✓ Shape: [1, 13, 8, 8]
- ✓ Dtype: float32
- ✓ Deterministic
- ✓ Handles starting position, mid-game, endgame

### Move Encoding
- ✓ Action range: [0, 4095]
- ✓ Round-trip encoding works
- ✓ Legal move masking functional
- ✓ Promotion handling (queen promotions)

### Network
- ✓ Forward pass produces correct shapes
- ✓ Policy sums to 1.0
- ✓ Value in range [-1, 1]
- ✓ Illegal moves masked to zero probability
- ✓ Inference time well under budget

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Network parameters | ~8.4M | 8.8M | ✓ |
| Inference time | <50ms | 1.7ms | ✓✓ |
| Memory usage | <2GB | <100MB | ✓✓ |

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Underpromotions**: Currently treats as out-of-range (simplified approach)
   - Queen promotions work correctly
   - Can extend to full 4288 action space if needed

2. **History planes**: Single position only (no move history)
   - Sufficient per YAGNI principle
   - Can add if network fails to learn positional understanding

3. **En passant**: Not explicitly encoded in metadata plane
   - Handled implicitly by FEN parsing
   - Can add if needed

---

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. **MCTS with NN guidance**: Replace random rollouts with network evaluation
2. **Self-play loop**: Generate training experiences
3. **Training loop**: Policy + value loss optimization
4. **Arena testing**: Evaluate model improvements
